= Woodcutter =
Woodcutter is a free and simple logging framework. It's installed by simply including the file "woodcutter.h" everywhere you need to log (or obviously in one header file that's included in every file you need to log). 

It can be configured (in any function, but usually main()) like this

    Woodcutter::minloglevel(INFO);

to set the minimal logging level. Allowed parameters are INFO, WARN, FATAL and ERROR. 

If you want pretty colors (in ANSI color code supporting terminals):

    Woodcutter::setColors(true);

Then use the functions

    LOGI("Some information");
    LOGW("Be warned, flux capacitor getting hot");
    LOGE("An error occured: something serious!")
    LOGF("The flux capacitor overloaded and now everything stops.");

Only the logging messages with a high enough warning level, as defined by minloglevel are displayed. INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL. 

After printing a FATAL message, the program will quit.
